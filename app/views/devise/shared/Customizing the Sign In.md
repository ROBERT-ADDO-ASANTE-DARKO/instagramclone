 ### Devise Views: Customizing the Sign In and Sign Up Pages

This code snippet is a partial view for the Devise gem, which is a popular authentication solution for Ruby on Rails applications. It provides the links for logging in, signing up, resetting passwords, and other authentication-related actions.

The code is written in ERB (Embedded Ruby), which is a templating language used in Rails. It starts with a conditional statement that checks if the current controller is not the `sessions` controller. If it's not, it renders a link to the login page.

Next, it checks if the registration feature is enabled in the Devise configuration and if the current controller is not the `registrations` controller. If both conditions are met, it renders a link to the sign-up page.

The code then checks if the password reset feature is enabled and if the current controller is not the `passwords` or `registrations` controllers. If these conditions are met, it renders a link to the password reset page.

It follows a similar pattern for the confirmation and unlock features, rendering links to the respective pages if they are enabled and the current controller is not the corresponding controller.

Finally, if the Devise gem is configured to use OmniAuth for social login, it iterates through the configured OmniAuth providers and renders a button for each provider. These buttons allow users to sign in using their social media accounts.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code starts with a conditional statement that checks if the current controller is not the `sessions` controller. If it's not, it renders a link to the login page using the `link_to` helper method.

2. Next, it checks if the registration feature is enabled in the Devise configuration and if the current controller is not the `registrations` controller. If both conditions are met, it renders a link to the sign-up page using the `link_to` helper method.

3. The code then checks if the password reset feature is enabled and if the current controller is not the `passwords` or `registrations` controllers. If these conditions are met, it renders a link to the password reset page using the `link_to` helper method.

4. It follows a similar pattern for the confirmation and unlock features, rendering links to the respective pages if they are enabled and the current controller is not the corresponding controller.
