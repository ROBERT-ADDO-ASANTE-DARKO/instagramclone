 ## Instagram Sign Up Page

This code snippet is a part of the sign-up page of an Instagram-like application. It's written in Ruby using the Rails framework and utilizes the Devise gem for user authentication. The code is structured into two main sections: the sign-up form and the redirect links.

### Sign-up Form

The sign-up form is where users enter their information to create an account. It consists of the following fields:

- **Name:** The user's full name.
- **Email:** The user's email address.
- **Password:** The user's password.
- **Password confirmation:** The user's password entered again for confirmation.

The form is generated using the `form_for` helper provided by Rails. This helper takes the resource (in this case, the `User` model) and the URL for the registration path as arguments. It then generates the necessary HTML markup for the form, including the input fields, labels, and submit button.

### Redirect Links

Below the sign-up form, there are two redirect links:

- **Log in:** This link takes the user to the login page.
- **Forgot password:** This link takes the user to the password reset page.

These links are generated using the `render` helper, which allows us to include partial views in our code. The partial views for these links are located in the `devise/shared` directory.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The `form_for` helper generates the HTML markup for the sign-up form.
2. The `text_field`, `email_field`, and `password_field` helpers generate the input fields for the name, email, password, and password confirmation.
3. The `submit` helper generates the submit button for the form.
4. The `render` helper includes the partial views for the redirect links.
5. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the `registration_path` URL, which is handled by the Devise gem.
6. Devise validates the user's input and creates a new user account if everything is valid.
7. The user is then redirected to the home page or another specified location.

### Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a sign-up form using Rails and Devise.
